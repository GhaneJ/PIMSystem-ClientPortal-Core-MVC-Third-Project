# PIMSystem-ClientPortal-Core-MVC-Third-Project
Product Information Management Dashboard Client

This part is the third and last part of a collection of three projects for simulating a Product Information Management system (PIM).

In this part the data is being created and stored in a client database and the created item name is compared with the item name and price created in the second project. If the item name exists,
then the price is being fetched from the server database into the client database and being shown in the third project, only when the status of the item is changed.
